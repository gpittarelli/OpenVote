			<b>OpenVote</b> is a new website to bring secure and confidential
			voting to communities around the world. We allow users to
			create polls and invite a list of emails to participate
			in the poll.
		</p>

		<p>
			OpenVote works by sending the participants in a poll a secure
			identifier which they use to confidentially vote in the
			poll.  At the end of the poll, anyone may download a list of
			votes in order to verify the results and ensure that their vote
			was counted correctly.
